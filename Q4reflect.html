    <b>At the end of 2nd Quarter,</b> I have learnt more about CASCADING STYLE SHEETS or CSS. CSS made<br>
    my website more advanced and pairs well with html. Although, 2nd Quarter is most likely just the<br>
    introduction of CSS and we will learn more about it in 3rd Quarter. Even though that there are<br>
    several properties and values in HTML and CSS, you will be used to it and you don't have to<br>
    memorize every single code but familiarize yourself with it. A website that could be used to<br>
    help you is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools.com.</a> This website contains every tutorials and
    guides that you will be<br> using in coding. Most likely as we progress in ICT subject, we will also be
    learning about<br>Javascript or scripting languages. Remember as well to be observant of your codes and<br>
    use your critical thinking skills in order for your website to function well.
